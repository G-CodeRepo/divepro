This is an implementation of a dive table app that scuba divers would use to determine the residual nitrogen levels left in their bodies based on the depth and bottom times of each of their dives. Import project in Eclipse and in the divePlan folder, run DivePlannerGUI.java Although the backend has been completed, do note that the GUI is incomplete, specifically in the 'History' option
